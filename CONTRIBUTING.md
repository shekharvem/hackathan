## Contributing

First off, thanks for even looking at this!  Contributions are most welcome!

The only special thing to really note is that this starer kit project is used within the `DotNetTemplates` repo, and that template will replace the special string of `rp-product` within this project to a user-supplied project name.  This really only comes up in the following files:

* `angular.json`
* `package.json`
* `angular-ci.yaml`

Other than that, just submit a pull request with your changes and and explanation, and it will be reviewed!  :)
